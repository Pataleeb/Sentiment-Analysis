# Sentiment-Analysis
We use the Bayes Classifier algorithm to fit a sentiment classifier.
Sentiment Analysis (also called opinion mining) is the process of using natural language processing (NLP), ML or statistical methods to identify and extract opinions or emotions from text. Therefore, sentiment analysis is used to gauge public opinion, customer feedback, or social media sentiment.

Sentiment classifiers are commonly used in NLP to determine whether a given text expresses a positive or negative sentiment.
Let's consider two test messages. "I experience this movie" and "Best day of my life". Based on our undestanding, the first sentence does not explicitly convey a strong positive or nagative sentiment. On the other hand, the second message, contains explicitly positive words such as "best" which strongly indicate a positive sentiment. 

Using below training messages let's try to classify above two messages.

Positive messages: I love this movie, Such an amazing experience, Best day of my life.

Negative messages: This movie is terrible, I hate this product, Worst service ever, Such a bad experience
